# Interactive-Image-Manipulation-with-jQuery
</br>
This project shows how to design an interactive web page with several jQuery animations and effects that let users edit an image. The page has several buttons that adjust various picture properties, including scaling, sliding, fading, and hiding. By clicking buttons, users can adjust the image's size and apply various effects, like fading in and out, sliding up and down, and even shrinking or resizing it.
</br>
The project is built using HTML, CSS (converted to JavaScript for inline styling), and jQuery for dynamic effects. It serves as a practical example of how jQuery can be used to enhance user experience by adding interactive and responsive features to web applications.

***Real-Time Stop: Stop any ongoing animation or effect instantly with a stop button.***
